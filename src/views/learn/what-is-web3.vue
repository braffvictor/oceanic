          Web3 is the name given to the concept of a decentralized internet
          built on blockchain technology. If web 1.0 was the creation of the
          internet and web 2.0 saw us move to a social platform-centric
          internet, web3 signifies a shift into a decentralized, public internet
          centered on the concept of ownership.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4 text-left">
          Web3, in essence, puts control and ownership back in the hands of the
          people using it, ideally creating a more equal playing field for users
          with less outside control from third parties. The term web3 has become
          shorthand for all of the elements that make up this ecosystem,
          including cryptocurrency, blockchain technology, decentralized finance
          (known as “DeFi”), NFTs, the metaverse, and decentralized apps
          (“dApps”).

      <div class="text-left mt-5">
        <p class="font-bold text-3xl">What is web3?</p>
        <p class="mt-2">
          In 2014, Gavin Wood, co-founder of the Ethereum blockchain and the
          Web3 Foundation, coined the term in a blog post. He wrote:
        </p>

        <p class="font-bold text-2xl mt-5 italic">
          Web 3.0, or as might be termed the “post-Snowden” web, is a
          re-imagination of the sorts of things we already use the web for, but
          with a fundamentally different model for the interactions between
          parties. Information that we assume to be public, we publish.
          Information we assume to be agreed upon, we place on a consensus
          ledger. Information that we assume to be private, we keep secret and
          never reveal.
        </p>

        <p class="mt-2">
          His post focused on the four main components of what he imagined this
          third wave of the internet would have: “static content publication,
          dynamic messages, trustless transactions and an integrated
          user-interface.” Today, much of web3 is built on these principles.
        </p>

        <p class="font-bold text-2xl mt-5">What were web 1.0 and web 2.0?</p>

        <p class="mt-2">
          When the internet reached mass adoption in the late ‘90s and early
          2000s, it was predominantly used as a way to gain information through
          text. This internet, web 1.0, was filled with personal blogs, company
          websites, and message boards, and it relied on open protocols. Mostly,
          it was static, which is just a fancy way of saying that the sites in
          web 1.0 weren’t particularly interactive. Many refer to this as the
          “read-only” web.
        </p>

        <p class="mt-2">
          Web 2.0 was the next phase of the internet, which has been largely
          defined by a move to the mobile internet, and led by social media
          platforms and large financial institutions. Most of the internet is
          still using web 2.0’s platforms and institutions. If you’re wondering
          if you’re using web 2.0, ask yourself which apps you used to
          communicate with your friends and family today, and how you most
          recently checked the balance of your checking account.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-2">
          The advent of web 2.0 saw people co-creating content with the websites
          and apps they were using (think: filling out and customizing your
          social media presence). But even if you’ve customized your profile and
          have made it feel like it’s your own, the images, data, and
          information you share on these platforms belong to the corporations
          that own them — not to you. Many refer to web 2.0 as the “read-write”
          web.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-2">
          And this brings us to web3. In the ideal vision of web3, the ownership
          is no longer in the hands of large corporations. Instead, it’s firmly
          with the people using it. And this is facilitated by the decentralized
          nature of the blockchain that allows users to publicly, permanently,
          immutably record the creation and ownership of their items. This is
          now being referred to as the “read-write-own” web.
        </p>

        <p class="font-bold text-2xl mt-5">
          What are the core principles of web3?
        </p>

        <p class="mt-2">
          First and foremost, it’s decentralized. Instead of being controlled by
          corporations and other large entities that can take users’ information
          and utilize it however they choose, web3 allows users to own their own
          information and items and distribute them how they see fit.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-2">
          Remember when Gavin Wood cited “trustless transactions” as one of the
          most important aspects of the internet of the future? That wasn’t
          random. He was looking at web 1.0 and web 2.0 and seeing the trust
          users had to give to third parties in order to interact online, and he
          envisioned a world in which that was no longer necessary.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-2">
          This is where blockchain technology comes in. The blockchain is
          basically a large, digital, public record. The most popular
          blockchains are distributed across many nodes (read: people’s
          computers), which is why you’ll hear them described as
          “decentralized.” So instead of a central company-owned server, the
          blockchain is distributed across a peer-to-peer network. This ensures
          that the blockchain remains immutable. And because the blockchain
          records and preserves history and acts as an unbiased party,
          transactions on it can be “trustless” in that they don’t require you
          to put your trust in someone in order to transact. Similarly, because
          the transactions are carried out by a network of computers, they are
          “permissionless” in that they don’t require the permission of a third
          party.
        </p>

        <p class="mt-2">
          Web3’s use of cryptocurrency gives users an option outside of the
          traditional banking system. In reality, many still use a combination
          of government currency held by banks and cryptocurrency, but it still
          enables users to operate outside of traditional centralized systems.
        </p>

        <p class="font-bold text-3xl mt-5">How is web3 being used now?</p>

        <p class="mt-2">
          We will undoubtedly continue to see web3 expand and evolve over the
          coming years, but currently, its primary uses are primarily focused on
          financial transactions and ownership.

        <p class="font-bold text-2xl mt-5">NFTs</p>

        <p class="mt-2">
          An NFT (non-fungible token) is a unique digital item stored on a
          blockchain. NFTs can represent almost anything, and serve as a digital
          record of ownership. NFTs come in the form of art, profile pictures,
          collectibles, domain names, ticketing and memberships, games and
          gaming tools, virtual worlds, and the list is ever-changing. New and
          emerging use cases include identity verification, intellectual
          property, and storage solutions.
        </p>

        <p class="font-bold text-2xl mt-5">Decentralized Finance (DeFi)</p>

        <p class="mt-2">
          Decentralized Finance, often shortened to simply “DeFi,” is the term
          used to describe all financial services that operate on blockchain
          technology. DeFi enables trustless, permissionless, and fast
          transactions.

        <p class="font-bold text-2xl mt-5">Cryptocurrency</p>
        <p class="mt-2">
          Cryptocurrency is digital currency backed by the blockchain. This
          allows transactions to be verified by a network of computers rather
          than a centralized entity or authority.
        </p>
        <p class="font-bold text-2xl mt-5">DAOs</p>
        <p class="mt-2">
          DAOs — decentralized autonomous organizations — are organizations
          without sole leadership. Instead, they’re governed by the group of
          users who comprise the organization. Often, the users within a DAO
          will create proposals that are voted on to enact changes. DAOs have
          their own tokens that allow users to prove membership and vote. DAOs
          can have a wide range of purposes — anything from charitable giving to
          business networking to education.
        </p>

        <p class="font-bold text-3xl mt-5">dApps</p>
        <p class="mt-2">
          dApps is a shortened form of “decentralized applications.” Unlike the
          apps utilized by web 2.0 that are owned by a single entity, dApps
          utilize blockchain technology, though they don’t necessarily need to
          be decentralized themselves. dApps can be operated via peer-to-peer
          network on the blockchain, or they can operate using traditional
          hierarchical structures, but what makes them dApps is their
          utilization of decentralized protocols.
        </p>

        <p class="font-bold text-3xl mt-5">Metaverse</p>
        <p class="mt-2">
          The metaverse refers to a virtual-and-augmented reality in which users
          can interact with the digital space. The metaverse is actually less of
          a place and more of a modality — it describes the way users interact
          with the internet rather than the location in which it happens. In the
          metaverse, users can play games, customize their look, connect with
          other players, and communicate. It’s a new way for people to use VR
          and AR to socialize. While not all metaverses are or will be built on
          web3 technology, those that do allow their users to own their own
          goods within the metaverse.
        </p>

        <p class="font-bold text-3xl mt-5">The future of web3</p>
        <p class="mt-2">
          Web3 is still a relatively new concept, and it will certainly continue
          to evolve throughout our lifetimes. It’s likely that the term “web3”
          will even feel outdated soon, as the elements described above become
          more widely-adopted and further integrated into our existing
          technologies.

            Stuart Haber and W. Scott Stornetta envisioned what many people have
            come to know as blockchain in 1991. Their first work involved
            working on a cryptographically secured chain of blocks whereby no
            one could tamper with the documents' timestamps. In 2008, Bitcoin
            was first introduced as a use for a blockchain.
          </p>
          <p class="text-sm font-light mt-4">
            It’s probable that the future of web3 will bring innovations like
            improved digital storage (moving from centralized cloud providers to
            decentralized solutions), faster and more secure internet browsers,
            large scale changes in the way we interact with financial systems,
            improved online gaming and social experiences, new social networks
            that allow users to fully own their own data, and even new desktop
            and mobile operating systems.

            Not all metaverses are or will be built on web3 technology, but the
            ones that are will have capabilities that are supported by
            blockchain technology. This means that a user can, for example, buy
            an NFT of a game element (think: a special shield or item of digital
            clothing) and not only instantly use it in the game they’re playing
            in the metaverse, but also be able to use the same item across
            multiple games. The decentralized nature of the blockchain means
            that metaverse experiences built on it are not beholden to a single
            game developer or brand, rather, they’re built to be co-created by
            the players.

            No one. The web3 ecosystem was designed to be decentralized, which
            means no singular entity, person, or company can own it. It’s
            operated by a network of computers that validates transactions,
            which makes it easier to authenticate ownership without the
            interference of anyone else.

            Actually, no. Web 3.0 refers to the Semantic Web, an internet of

            article.
