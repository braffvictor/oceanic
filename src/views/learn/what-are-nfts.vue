          An NFT (non-fungible token) is a unique digital item stored on a
          blockchain. NFTs can represent almost anything, and serve as a digital
          record of ownership.
        </p>
      </div>

      <!-- plenty text -->
      <div class="text-left mt-5">
        <p class="font-bold text-3xl">Fungible vs. non-fungible</p>
        <p class="mt-2">
          Before we dive into NFTs, it’s important to understand the
          “non-fungible” part of “non-fungible token.” When an item is fungible,
          it means it’s interchangeable with another of the same item. A classic
          example is a $1 dollar bill: you could swap dollars with someone and
          you’d both still have $1.
        </p>

        <p class="mt-2">
          Non-fungible, on the other hand, means the item is totally unique, and
          therefore has its own unique value. For example, two cars of the same
          make and model might have different values based on how many miles are
          on the odometer, their accident records, or if it was previously owned
          by a celebrity.
        </p>

        <p class="font-bold text-3xl mt-5">How do NFTs work?</p>

        <p class="mt-2">
          NFTs operate on blockchain technology. The blockchain is basically a
          large, digital, public record. The most popular blockchains are
          distributed across many nodes (read: people’s computers), which is why
          you’ll hear them described as “decentralized.”
        </p>
        <p class="mt-2">
          So instead of a central company-owned server, the blockchain is
          distributed across a peer-to-peer network. Not only does this ensure
          that the blockchain remains immutable, it also allows the node
          operators to earn money, instead of a single company. Because the
          blockchain records and preserves history, it is uniquely positioned to
          transform provable authenticity and digital ownership.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-2">
          When someone creates, transfers, buys, sells, or otherwise does
          something with an NFT, that all gets recorded on the blockchain. This
          is what enables authentication.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-2">
          This record serves as a permanent statement of authenticity that can
          be viewed or accessed by anyone. Today, when you buy a piece of art or
          a collector's item, it typically comes with a paper certificate of
          authenticity, which you must then keep track of forever. It is easily
          forgotten, lost or destroyed, creating a very fragile system for
          authenticity. Blockchain’s offer a simple and more secure solution to
          this long standing issue of proving authenticity.
        </p>

        <p class="font-bold text-3xl mt-5">What are NFTs used for?</p>
        <p class="mt-2">
          An NFT can represent anything, but let’s explore some of the ways NFTs
          are being used today, and potential implementations for the future.
        </p>
        <p class="font-bold text-2xl mt-5">Art NFTs</p>
        <p class="mt-2">
          An art NFT is a type of NFT that represents a piece of digital art,
          such as a drawing, painting, or piece of digital artwork. Each art NFT
          is unique and traceable to the original creator of the NFT, and that
          connection to the creator may be valuable as well. Art NFTs are a new
          form of digital art that can be collected and sold, similar to
          physical artwork. Art NFTs can also have additional utility (for
          example, owning the NFT may also give you commercial rights to use the
          underlying artwork).
        </p>
        <p class="mt-2">
          Artists are creating incredible and novel pieces with NFTs. Damien
          Hirst used NFTs in his collection “The Currency”, in which he created
          digital versions of 10,000 unique physical paintings. Collectors had
          one year to decide if they wanted the digital or the physical version
          of the painting— whichever version they did not choose would be
          destroyed.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-2">
          This record serves as a permanent statement of authenticity that can
          be viewed or accessed by anyone. Today, when you buy a piece of art or
          a collector's item, it typically comes with a paper certificate of
          authenticity, which you must then keep track of forever. It is easily
          forgotten, lost or destroyed, creating a very fragile system for
          authenticity. Blockchain’s offer a simple and more secure solution to
          this long standing issue of proving authenticity.
        </p>

        <p class="font-bold text-2xl mt-5">Profile picture NFTs (PFPs)</p>
        <p class="mt-2">
          A profile picture, or PFP, NFT is any NFT that's primary purpose is
          use as a social media profile picture, or avatar. These NFTs are
          digital items that are authenticated on a blockchain network, making
          them verifiably unique. Some PFP NFTs also grant access to designated
          online communities.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-2">
          Profile picture NFTs come in various forms, ranging from static images
          to animated or interactive designs. They may be based on characters,
          take the form of animals, look like humans, or be abstract.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-2">
          These are probably the projects you’ve heard the most about: Bored Ape
          Yacht Club (BAYC), Doodles, World of Women (WoW), and more. For many
          people on the internet, these PFPs actually become their online
          identity. Not only do they identify with the group, they strongly
          identify with their avatar. PFP projects are also centered around
          holder benefits (like BAYC’s famous yacht party) and community (like
          WoW, which donates a portion of their creator earnings to
          women-centric charities).
        </p>

        <p class="font-bold text-2xl mt-5">Music NFTs</p>
        <p class="mt-2">
          A music NFT is any NFT that represents ownership of music or an
          experience tied to music, like a live concert event or a virtual fan
          meet-and-greet. Music NFTs are created by minting a unique token on a
          blockchain, which can then be collected by music fans.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-2">
          Music NFTs can be created by new artists and musicians with large
          fanbases. These NFTs can include anything from a recording to a
          composition to ticketing for a music experience. The content of each
          music NFT varies based on the creator and the work they decide to
          create.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-2">
          Any artist can create a single song or audio file as an NFT. For
          example, omgkirby partnered with Channel Tres to create a collection
          of 5,550 unique songs, each with its own BPM and key. Each song comes
          with vocals and production by Channel Tres.

        </p>
        <p class="mt-2">
          NFTs bring some extra oomph to your traditional collectibles. Instead
          of a physical basketball trading card that sits in a binder under your
          bed, you can collect dynamic NFTs from the NBA’s collection “The
          Association,” where each card changes based on that player and team’s
          performance.

        <p class="font-bold text-2xl mt-5">Photography NFTs</p>
        <p class="mt-2">
          A photography NFT is a unique digital asset that represents a specific
          photograph or artwork. It is stored and recorded on a blockchain, a
          decentralized, immutable digital ledger technology.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-2">
          Photography NFTs are stored and transferred digitally, allowing them
          to be easily shared and displayed online. The ownership and
          authenticity of a photography NFT is verified and recorded on the
          blockchain, allowing it to be easily transferred between users.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-2">
          NFTs offer a way for photographers and artists to sell and distribute
          their work in a digital format, while also providing collectors with a
          unique and verifiable digital item.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-2">
          Justin Aversano made headlines with his Twin Flames collection, a
          collection of 100 twin portraits. Aversano drew inspiration from his
          relationship with his fraternal twin for this collection. The “Twin
          Flames” collection became known as the first major NFT photography
          collection of its kind and catapulted Aversano into one of the world's
          highest-selling photographers.
