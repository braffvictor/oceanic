          A blockchain is a digitally distributed ledger that records
          transactions and information across a decentralized network. There are
          different types of blockchains. OpenSea is compatible with the
          Ethereum, Polygon, Klaytn, Arbitrum, Optimism, Avalanche, and BNB
          Chain blockchains.
        </p>

      <div class="text-left mt-5">
        <p class="font-bold text-3xl">What is a blockchain?</p>
        <p class="mt-2">
          A blockchain is a decentralized record that gets its name from how it
          stores its data. Once a set of transaction data reaches a certain
          size, it forms a "block.” This is where every transaction on a
          blockchain is validated and then permanently stored. The “chain” part
          of a blockchain is a series of consecutive blocks linked together,
          forming the immutable ledger.
        </p>

        <p class="font-bold text-3xl mt-5">
          How is a blockchain different from a traditional database?
        </p>

        <p class="mt-2">
          A blockchain differs from a traditional database in two ways: how it
          operates and who is responsible for it. A blockchain operates
          independently of a company or financial institution’s oversight, while
          a traditional database is typically owned and operated by a single
          entity. It allows for trustless and permissionless transactions
        </p>
        <p class="mt-2">
          Below are five unique characteristics that define blockchain
          technology:
        </p>

        <p class="font-bold text-2xl mt-5">Polygon</p>

        <p class="mt-2">
          Polygon is an EVM-compatible Ethereum sidechain that uses the
          Proof-of-Stake method of validation. This means Polygon is its own
          blockchain, but it benefits from and is compatible with Ethereum in a
          few important ways. Polygon’s native token is MATIC. In 2022, Polygon
          pledged to go carbon neutral.
        </p>

        <p class="font-bold text-2xl mt-5">Decentralization</p>

        <p class="mt-2">
          No single entity owns each blockchain or the underlying technology
          (the way a central bank or corporation would). Instead, each
          blockchain is upheld by a multitude of computers (“nodes”) that
          validate transactions. Consensus mechanisms ensure a blockchain’s
          security (more on this below).
        </p>
        <p class="font-bold text-2xl mt-5">
          Validated by multiple independent nodes
        </p>

        <p class="mt-2">
          A consensus mechanism uses multiple independent nodes (or computers)
          to validate any digital items or information stored on the blockchain.
          There are two main types of consensus mechanisms, Proof-of-Stake and
          Proof-of-Work. Once a set amount of these transactions are validated
          and recorded, a new block is added to the blockchain.
        </p>

        <p class="font-bold text-2xl mt-5">Public and transparent</p>

        <p class="mt-2">
          Blockchain’s decentralized system allows for the ledger to be public
          and transparent while still remaining anonymous. Each transaction is
          recorded permanently and is accessible to the public.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-2">
          In 2016, Fabricio Santos described the concept of the blockchain as a
          bank vault filled with rows of glass deposit boxes that allow everyone
          to see the contents of the boxes without being able to access their
          contents. He continued the metaphor by explaining that when a person
          opens a new deposit box, they receive a key unique to that box, but
          making a copy of the key does not duplicate the box's contents; it
          only provides access.
        </p>

        <p class="font-bold text-2xl mt-5">Trustless and permissionless</p>

        <p class="mt-2">
          The blockchain records and preserves history and acts as an unbiased
          party in transactions. For that reason, it’s “trustless” in that it
          doesn’t require you to put your trust in another organization or
          entity in order to transact. Similarly, because the transactions are
          carried out by a network of computers, they are “permissionless” in
          that they don’t require the permission of a third party.
        </p>

        <p class="font-bold text-3xl mt-5">Types of blockchains</p>

        <p class="mt-2">
          here are different types of blockchains, and each has varying gas fees
          and scalability.
        </p>

        <p class="font-bold text-2xl mt-5">Layer 1 blockchains</p>

        <p class="mt-2">
          Layer 1 (also called "L1") blockchains are the main, or base level,
          blockchains. This means they execute and validate transactions on
          their own, without assistance. Ethereum, Solana, and Avalanche are
          Layer 1 chains. All three of these L1 chains don't require help from
          other systems to run, and each has their own associated
          cryptocurrencies.
        </p>

        <p class="font-bold text-2xl mt-5">Layer 2 blockchains</p>

        <p class="mt-2">
          Layer 2 (or "L2") blockchains act as scaling solutions for Layer 1s.
          Layer 2 chains process transactions on their chain and then store a
          summary of the completed actions on the Layer 1 chain. Optimism and
          Arbitrum are considered Layer 2 "rollups" because their transactions
          occur off-chain and are then added to the Layer 1, or base, chain when
          completed. This significantly lowers the demands on the blockchain,
          improving scalability and lowering its gas fees.
        </p>

        <p class="font-bold text-2xl mt-5">Sidechains</p>

        <p class="mt-2">
          Finally, there is a type of chain called a "sidechain" which is a
          separate, independent blockchain that's linked to the Layer 1 chain
          via a two-way bridge. Sidechains, like Polygon, are designed to
          process transactions efficiently and are essentially self-contained
          blockchains responsible for their own security. What connects them to
          the main blockchain is their ability to transfer digital items to the
          main blockchain. In the case of Polygon, an Ethereum-compatible chain,
          users get an experience similar to using Ethereum but with potentially
          lower gas fees and faster transaction times.
        </p>
        <p class="font-bold text-3xl mt-5">Consensus mechanisms</p>

        <p class="mt-2">
          As we mentioned earlier, blockchain transactions need to be validated
          by nodes on the network. Consensus mechanisms are how the transactions
          are validated— they’re how all the nodes agree that a transaction
          should be permanently recorded (hence “consensus”). There are two main
          types of consensus mechanisms, Proof of Stake and Proof of Work.

        <p class="font-bold text-2xl mt-5">The Proof-of-Stake method</p>
        <p class="mt-2">
          Blockchains that use the Proof-of-Stake method verify transactions
          using validators. When a new transaction is potentially going to be
          added to the blockchain, a validator is randomly selected to be a
          block proposer. This validator will then create a new block and send
          it to the other nodes on the network. For each new slot, a committee
          of validators is chosen and it is their votes that determine the
          block's validity. An example of a blockchain that uses Proof-of-Stake
          is Ethereum.
        </p>
        <p class="font-bold text-2xl mt-5">The Proof-of-Work method</p>
        <p class="mt-2">
          Blockchains that use the Proof-of-Work method verify transactions
          using miners. Proof-of-Work blockchains use extreme computational
          output (the “work”) and consensus as barriers to bad actors writing
          invalid transactions to the blockchain. When a new transaction is
          potentially going to be added to the blockchain, a bunch of miners
          (rather, their computers) will race to solve a complex math equation.
          After someone solves it, several other miners will verify that their
          answer is correct. If everyone agrees that the fastest miner’s output
          is correct, the transaction will be recorded to the blockchain, and
          the miner will be awarded a fee for the energy used to complete the
          computation.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-2">
          With Proof-of-Work, not only do several miners need to agree on a
          transaction’s validity, but the barrier to entry for a bad actor is
          extremely high due to the computational work and energy required to
          validate a transaction. For example, there are only a set number of
          Bitcoin in existence. Therefore, in order to mine each subsequent
          coin, a more complex problem needs to be solved. This also makes
          transactions more expensive.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-2">
          Both of these methods are complex, time-consuming, and ultimately
          ensure the security of the blockchain, which is why the gas fees are
          awarded to the operators.
        </p>

        <p class="font-bold text-3xl mt-5">Gas fees</p>
        <p class="mt-2">
          In web3, the term “gas fee” refers to the payment needed to execute
          transactions on the blockchain. These payments compensate the node
          operators who keep the blockchain functioning. This validation helps
          ensure the blockchain has a permanent, immutable record. Each
          blockchain compatible with OpenSea (Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum,
          Optimism, and Klaytn) has different gas fees. These fees differ
          depending on how each chain validates transactions.

            Stuart Haber and W. Scott Stornetta envisioned what many people have
            come to know as blockchain in 1991. Their first work involved
            working on a cryptographically secured chain of blocks whereby no
            one could tamper with the documents' timestamps. In 2008, Bitcoin
            was first introduced as a use for a blockchain.

          </p>
          <p class="text-sm font-light mt-4">
            A DAO is a decentralized autonomous organization that uses
            blockchain technology to remain decentralized without needing a
            traditional hierarchical structure or a leading administrative
            entity. DAO members share a common goal and vote to make, change, or
            enact rules. Because of the blockchain, all actions the DAO takes
            are publically viewable and immutable.

            Chains usually have a website where you can view all the
            transactions made on that blockchain. For example, Polygonscan for
            Polygon or Etherscan for Ethereum. If you've sold an item on
            Ethereum, you can search your wallet address to see your token
            balance or enter a transaction hash to verify transaction history.
            It's an easy way to verify whether a transaction was completed.
